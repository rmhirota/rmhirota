### Hi there 👋

My name is Renata Hirota and I'm a statistician / journalist.

🔭 I’m currently a researcher at [ABJ](https://abj.org.br/), where I work with jurimetrics, or the application of quantitative methods to law. 
🌱 I also occasionally work with data journalism, analysing data for stories or developing applications for journalistic purposes.
👩🏻‍💻 I love everything R and I'm part of [R-Ladies Sao Paulo](https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/rladies-sao-paulo/).
⚾️ My hobbies include playing baseball and D&D 🎲🐉
