### Hi there 👋

My name is Renata Hirota and I'm a data journalist and MSc candidate in statistics at the University of Sao Paulo.

💼 I’m currently a statistician at [Mtrix](https://www.mtrix.com.br/), where I work with the Operations team to optimize our processes, from identifying inconsistencies to improving data products.

🌱 I also work with data journalism at [InfoAmazonia](https://infoamazonia.org/en/), analysing data for stories about climate change and deforestation.

👩🏻‍💻 I love everything R and I'm part of [R-Ladies Sao Paulo](https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/rladies-sao-paulo/).

⚾️ My hobbies include playing baseball and D&D 🎲🐉
